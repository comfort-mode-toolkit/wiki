## How We Work: Play, Learn, Build (For Real People)

### Rooted in Community
Every idea starts with real needs from real folks—users, makers, dreamers, and anyone who’s ever muttered “who picked these colors?” at their screen. We listen, share, and build together.

### Grounded in Evidence (Minus the Jargon)
We dig into research, stories, and accessibility wisdom—then turn the tricky stuff into simple, practical tools and tips. No advanced degree required, just curiosity.

### Open, Always
Everything we do is out in the open. Ideas, messy sketches, research, and decisions all happen where everyone can see, chime in, or just watch the sandcastles take shape. Your voice counts—whether you’re new or a seasoned pro.

### Designed for Real Diversity
Accessibility isn’t a single checkbox. Needs are as varied as people, and that’s something to celebrate. Our toolkit flexes, adapts, and invites everyone to shape what comfort means.

## The Five Pillars of Comfort Mode

These aren’t just feel-good slogans—they’re baked into every decision we make.

### 1. User Autonomy
You call the shots. Pick your colors, fonts, motion—whatever helps you feel at home online. Comfort Mode is about your choices, not one-size-fits-all.

### 2. Inclusion Means Personalization
Nobody’s “average.” Mix and match what works for you—dyslexia-friendly fonts, less animation, softer colors, and more. Inclusion means meeting you where you are.

### 3. Design That Feels Good
Accessible can be beautiful. We’re showing that you don’t have to trade looks for kindness. Brands keep their style, users get comfort—everyone wins.

### 4. Co-Design, Always
The best ideas come from building together. We test, listen, and tweak based on what real people say—not just what looks good on paper.

### 5. Comfort Is Dignity
Everyone deserves to feel safe and comfortable online. Comfort Mode gives you choices, not labels. No explanations needed—just a kinder web for all.
