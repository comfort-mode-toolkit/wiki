# Comfort Commons Culture

Welcome to the seaside forest! Here’s what we’re about—no buzzwords, no gatekeeping, just the real stuff.

---

## We Play

We build sandcastles, doodle wild ideas, and experiment without fear of failure. Play isn’t just for kids—it’s how we learn, invent, and stay curious. If you have a wild idea, try it! If it flops, we’ll laugh, learn, and build another one together.

---

## We’re Kind

Kindness is our baseline. We take care of ourselves and each other. That means respecting boundaries, being patient, celebrating wins (even small ones), and saying thanks. If someone’s having a tough day, we give them space or help them out. We make space for imperfect people, because we’re all imperfect.

---

## We Listen

Everyone has something to teach. We listen to voices that don’t usually get heard. We listen to users, to each other, to ourselves. If someone says “this isn’t working for me,” that’s a gift, not a complaint.

---

## We Welcome Everyone

No one needs to “earn” a place here. You don’t need credentials, experience, or a certain way of speaking. You don’t even need to write code! Curiosity, kindness, and a willingness to try are enough.

---

## We Build for Real Needs

We’re not here to win prizes or impress “the industry.” We care about making tech softer, more humane, and helpful for real people with real lives. Accessibility is a journey, not a checkbox.

---

## We’re Open (for Real)

All our work, our messy drafts, our clever fixes, our mistakes—they’re out in the open. If you want to see how something works, you can. If you want to change something, you can. If you want to just lurk and watch, that’s fine too.

---

## We Grow Together

Every sandcastle is a team effort. We help each other, cheer each other on, and try new things together. If you teach something, you’re a leader. If you ask for help, you’re brave. If you mess up, you’re human.

---

## TL;DR

Come as you are. Build, play, learn, mess up, and help us make the web a little kinder. That’s the Comfort Commons way.
