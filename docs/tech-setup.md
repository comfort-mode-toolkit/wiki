# Tech Setup Guide üõ†Ô∏è
*Don't worry, it's not as scary as it sounds - we got you!*

Whether you want to fix a typo or build the next amazing accessibility tool, here's how to get set up. Pick your adventure level!

## üå± Level 1: Just Want to Edit Docs or Add Ideas?
*No scary terminal commands needed!*

**You just need:** A GitHub account (it's free!)

### Quick Start:
1. **Sign up for GitHub** at [github.com](https://github.com) if you don't have an account
2. **Find what you want to change** - browse our repositories and find a file you want to edit
3. **Click the pencil icon** (‚úèÔ∏è) on any file to edit it directly in your browser
4. **Make your changes** using the built-in editor
5. **Scroll down and describe your changes** in the text boxes
6. **Click "Propose changes"** - this creates what we call a "pull request"
7. **Wait for review** - someone will look at your changes and merge them!

**That's it!** No software to install, no commands to remember. GitHub handles everything in your browser.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Level 2: Want to Code or Make Bigger Changes?
*Time to set up your development sandbox!*

### One-Time Setup (Do This Once)

#### Step 1: Install Git
**What it is:** Git tracks changes to code so teams can work together without chaos.

**Mac users:**
- Git might already be installed! Open Terminal and type: `git --version`
- If not installed, it'll prompt you to install it, or download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)

**Windows users:**
- Download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) 
- Install with default settings (just keep clicking "Next")

**Linux users:**
- You probably already know: `sudo apt install git` or `sudo yum install git`

#### Step 2: GitHub Account Setup
1. **Sign up at [github.com](https://github.com)** if you haven't already
2. **Set up SSH keys** (this lets you push code without typing your password every time)
   
   In your terminal/command prompt:
   
   ```bash
   # Generate a new SSH key (replace email with yours)
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   
   # When prompted, just press Enter for default location
   # Set a passphrase or press Enter to skip
   ```
   

4. **Add the SSH key to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   # Copy your public key (this command works on Mac/Linux)
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   
   # On Windows, use:
   type %USERPROFILE%\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub
   ```
   - Copy the output
   - Go to GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí SSH and GPG keys ‚Üí New SSH key
   - Paste your key and save

5. **Tell Git who you are:**
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
   ```

**Test it works:** `ssh -T git@github.com` should say "Hi [username]!"

#### Step 3: Install Python (for our current tools)
**What it is:** The programming language most of our tools use.

- **Download Python 3.8 or newer** from [python.org](https://python.org)
- **During installation:** Check "Add Python to PATH" (very important!)
- **Test it works:** Open terminal and type `python --version`

### For Each Project You Want to Work On

Let's say you want to work on CM-Colors. Here's the dance:

#### Step 1: Fork the Repository
1. **Go to the project page** (like [github.com/comfort-mode-toolkit/cm-colors](https://github.com/comfort-mode-toolkit/cm-colors))
2. **Click "Fork"** in the top-right corner
3. **This creates your own copy** you can mess with safely

#### Step 2: Clone Your Fork
**What this means:** Download the code to your computer so you can edit it.

```bash
# Get the URL from your fork (green "Code" button)
git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/cm-colors.git

# Go into the folder
cd cm-colors
```

#### Step 3: Set Up Your Environment
**Why:** Keeps this project's requirements separate from other Python projects.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (like a clean room for this project)
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install what the project needs
pip install -r requirements.txt

# If there's also a requirements-dev.txt (for development tools):
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

**You'll know it worked when** your terminal prompt shows `(venv)` at the beginning.

#### Step 4: Make Your Changes
1. **Open the folder** in your favorite code editor (VS Code, PyCharm, whatever you like)
2. **Make your changes** - fix bugs, add features, update docs
3. **Test your changes** - run any tests, try the tool yourself

#### Step 5: Save and Share Your Work
```bash
# See what you changed
git status

# Add your changes to be saved
git add .

# Save them with a message describing what you did
git commit -m "Fix color contrast calculation for edge case"

# Send your changes to your GitHub fork
git push origin main
```

#### Step 6: Create a Pull Request
1. **Go to your fork on GitHub** - there should be a banner saying "Compare & pull request"
2. **Click it** (or go to the original repo and click "New pull request")
3. **Fill out the template** we provide
4. **Submit and wait for review!**

## üÜò When Things Go Wrong

### "Command not found" errors
- **On Windows:** Make sure you checked "Add to PATH" during installation
- **Restart your terminal** after installing new software
- **Try the full path:** Instead of `python`, try `/usr/bin/python3` or `C:\Python39\python.exe`

### SSH/Git authentication issues
- **Check your SSH key:** `ssh -T git@github.com` should work
- **Use HTTPS instead:** Replace `git@github.com:` with `https://github.com/` in clone URLs
- **GitHub has good docs:** Search "GitHub SSH setup" for detailed help

### Python/pip issues
- **Use python3:** On some systems, `python` is Python 2, use `python3` instead
- **Virtual environment not working:** Make sure you activated it (`source venv/bin/activate`)
- **Permission errors:** Don't use `sudo` with pip, fix your virtual environment instead

### Git confusing you
- **Start over:** Delete the folder and clone again (your GitHub fork is safe)
- **Undo last commit:** `git reset --soft HEAD~1`
- **When all else fails:** Ask in the GitHub discussions, we've all been there!

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Glossary

**Clone:** Download a copy of code from GitHub to your computer

**Commit:** Save a set of changes with a message describing what you did

**Fork:** Make your own copy of someone else's project on GitHub

**Git:** Tool that tracks changes to code so teams can work together

**Pull Request (PR):** Way to submit your changes back to the original project

**Repository (repo):** A project's folder containing all its code and history

**SSH Key:** A secure way to prove your identity to GitHub without passwords

**Terminal/Command Line:** Text-based way to talk to your computer (scary looking, actually friendly)

**Virtual Environment:** Isolated space for a project's requirements so they don't conflict with other projects

## Quick Reference Card

```bash
# Daily workflow after initial setup:
cd your-project-folder
source venv/bin/activate  # (or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows)
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Describe what you did"
git push origin main
# Go to GitHub to create pull request
```

Save this page - you'll probably need to reference it until the commands become muscle memory!
