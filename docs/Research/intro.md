# Research Hub üî¨‚ú®
*Where curious minds gather to figure out what actually works (and what definitely doesn't)*

Welcome to our research corner of the forest! This is where we dig into the real questions, test our assumptions, and occasionally discover that what we thought we knew was completely wrong. Think of it as our community's investigation headquarters‚Äîwhere every üßô Mage quest begins.

**Not here for deep dives?** That's perfectly fine! Each section has a quick summary so you can grab what you need and get back to building cool stuff with the ‚öîÔ∏è Warriors.

## What Counts as "Research" in Our Commons?
We're not writing papers to impress professors in ivory towers. We're collecting insights that help real developers, designers, and product folks build experiences that actually work for people. Think of it as "detective work that matters to folks doing real work in the world."

Whether you're a natural üßô Mage who loves diving deep, a üèπ Ranger who discovers things while exploring, or any other role curious about understanding problems better‚Äîthis is your playground.

## üåü Getting Started on Your Research Adventure

### New to the Research Quests?
**Start here:** Browse our [current research expeditions](https://github.com/comfort-mode-toolkit/cm-hub/issues) to see what mysteries we're actively solving.

**How your quest works:**
1. **üó∫Ô∏è Scout the terrain:** Look through issues for topics that spark your curiosity
2. **üèïÔ∏è Claim your expedition:** Comment on an unassigned issue to join that quest
3. **üß≠ Chart your own course:** If you see a different angle, create a new expedition and reference the original
4. **üì° Send signals:** Update your progress by the end of week 1 (we worry if our adventurers go quiet!)
5. **üéÅ Share your discoveries:** Submit your research following our friendly templates

### Quest Duration Guide
| Quest Type | Typical Adventure Length | Week 1 Signal Required |
|------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Knowledge Gathering (Literature Review) | 2-3 weeks | Share what sources you've found and first "aha!" moments |
| Field Study (Case Study) | 1-2 weeks | Community identified and first conversations started |
| Tool Exploration (Tools Collection) | 2-3 weeks | Territory mapped and initial discoveries logged |
| Quest Proposal | 1 week | Problem outlined and adventure plan drafted |
| Building Blueprint (Tech Proposal) | 1-2 weeks | Technical approach sketched and feasibility explored |

### What Makes a Great Discovery?
**For new adventurers:** We provide maps and examples. Focus on clear insights and practical wisdom over impressive-sounding complexity.

**For seasoned explorers:** Keep that accessible spirit while bringing your expertise to help others. Think of yourself as a guide helping others navigate complex territory.

**For everyone:** 
- Support your insights with evidence (but explain why it matters!)
- Write like you're talking to a fellow adventurer, not giving a lecture
- Include "so what can I actually do with this?" takeaways
- Be honest about what you don't know yet

## üìö Knowledge Gathering Expeditions
*"What does the actual science say about [insert mystery]?"*

**The Mission:** Academic papers are often locked away like treasure behind paywalls, written in ancient language that requires a decoder ring. We read them so you don't have to, then translate the useful gems into language that actual humans can understand and use.

**What Lives Here:**
- Research paper translations (from academic-speak to human-speak)
- "Okay but what does this mean for my app?" sections
- Myth-busting adventures
- Evidence for/against popular practices

**üßô Mage Quest Template:**
```

## üåü Quality Standards (Not Academic Intimidation!)

### What Makes Great Research in Our Commons
- **Clarity over complexity:** If a curious 12-year-old can't understand your summary, let's make it clearer
- **Evidence over opinion:** Back up insights with sources, but explain why they matter to real work
- **Practical over theoretical:** Focus on what people can actually use in their adventures
- **Honest over promotional:** If something doesn't work well, say so (kindly and constructively)

### How We Review Discoveries
1. Community feedback period (1 week for major contributions)
2. Fact-check for claims and sources
3. "Does this actually help builders?" readability check
4. "Does this fit with our other work?" integration review

### Our Commons Style
- Talk directly to readers ("you" not "one" or "users")
- Explain technical terms when you first use them
- Include code examples when they help understanding
- Add gentle humor if it serves the explanation (not just for laughs)
- Link generously but don't assume people will click through

## üîç Current Quest Priorities
*The mysteries we're most curious about right now*

1. **üåä Vestibular challenges and color triggers** (sparked by our Reddit community exploration)
2. **üõ°Ô∏è What stops developers from adopting accessibility tools** 
3. **üåà How color perception differs across cultures**
4. **‚ö° Performance impact of real-time accessibility adjustments**

## üìñ Terms We Can't Avoid (But We'll Explain Them!)

**The Rule:** If there's a simpler way to say it, we use that instead. Only including terms that are unavoidable in this work.

**Format:**
**Term:** Simple explanation first, then technical definition if needed
*Example: How it's used in practice*

---

**Questions about contributing research?** Open an issue and tag it with `research-question`. We're here to help fellow adventurers, not guard the gates to knowledge.

*Making accessibility research actually accessible, one plain-English explanation at a time‚Äîbecause the best discoveries are the ones everyone can understand and use* üåàüî¨‚ú®
