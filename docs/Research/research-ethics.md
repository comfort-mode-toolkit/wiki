# Ethics Guide 🛡️✨
*Protecting everyone who makes this work possible*

## Our Sacred Law of the Commons
**People first, research second.** Always and forever.

We're building tools to help people thrive, not studying them like specimens in a lab. Every person who shares their story, every 🧙 Mage who contributes wisdom, every 💚 Healer who gives feedback, every community member who trusts us with their experience deserves respect, privacy, and dignity.

Think of this as our community's protective magic—the spells that keep everyone safe while we adventure together.

## 🔒 Protecting the People Who Trust Us

### The Unbreakable Rules of Our Forest

**1. No Labels, Ever—People Are Not Categories**
- Never call people "disabled users," "normal users," or any other label that reduces them to a condition
- Use "people who..." phrasing: "people who experience vestibular challenges," not "vestibular patients"  
- Skip medical jargon unless someone specifically uses it to describe themselves
- Remember: every person is a whole human with complex experiences, not a walking accessibility case study

**2. Consent is Sacred Magic**
- Always ask before quoting someone from forums, social media, or communities
- Get clear permission before sharing screenshots that include usernames
- Honor when people say "no" or want to stay anonymous—no questions asked
- If someone changes their mind later, remove their content immediately (no guilt trips)

**3. Privacy by Design—Invisible by Default**
- Anonymize everything unless someone specifically asks for credit
- Scrub usernames, handles, and identifying details unless explicitly okay'd
- Don't play detective trying to connect posts to real people
- Store personal data like treasure—secure it well and delete it when the quest is complete

**4. Community Respect—We're Guests, Not Conquerors**
- Don't treat communities like "research subjects"—they're our wise advisors and partners
- Give back to communities that help us (share findings, tools, resources)
- Follow community rules and understand their culture before exploring
- Never extract value without contributing value in return

### What Respectful Practice Looks Like in Action

**🌟 Excellent Approach:**
- "Community members shared that high contrast modes triggered headaches during long browsing sessions"
- "A developer in our survey mentioned struggling to integrate accessibility tools into their workflow"
- "Forum discussions revealed common patterns around color sensitivity that we hadn't considered"

**⚠️ Definitely Don't Do This:**
- "Disabled users complained about contrast issues"
- "@username123 from Reddit said accessibility tools are garbage"
- "Vestibular patients can't handle certain color combinations"

## 📋 Research Standards (Our Quest Guidelines)

### Before You Start Any Investigation

**🧙 Mage Wisdom Check—Ask yourself:**
1. **Does this actually help people?** Not just advance knowledge, but genuinely improve lives?
2. **Could this accidentally harm someone?** Even with the best intentions?
3. **Do I have proper permission?** From everyone whose words/experiences I'm using?
4. **Am I approaching this with respect?** For communities, individuals, and their lived experiences?

### Data Collection Ethics (Gathering Information Responsibly)

**When exploring and collecting wisdom:**
- **🌐 Public ≠ permissible:** Just because something is posted publicly doesn't mean it's fair game for research
- **🎭 Context matters deeply:** A casual comment in a support forum isn't the same as a formal interview response
- **👶 Age matters:** Extra caution with any content from adventurers under 18
- **💚 Vulnerability matters:** Be especially gentle with mental health, medical, or crisis-related content

### Reporting Standards (Sharing Your Discoveries)

**In your research contributions:**
- **🔍 Acknowledge what you don't know:** Gaps in knowledge are as important as discoveries
- **⚖️ Avoid overgeneralization:** Don't assume small samples represent entire populations
- **📝 Show your work:** Explain how you gathered information and reached conclusions
- **🌈 Include diverse voices:** Don't let one perspective dominate the story
- **🪞 Be transparent about bias:** We all have them—acknowledge yours openly

## ⚠️ Red Flags and Storm Warnings

### 🚨 Stop Your Quest and Reconsider If:
- Someone seems to be in crisis or serious distress
- You're working with minors without proper protections
- Your research could identify specific people against their wishes
- You're venturing into medical/therapeutic territory (we're builders, not healers)
- Communities or individuals are expressing discomfort with your approach
- You catch yourself making sweeping assumptions about entire groups

### 🤔 When Uncertainty Strikes:
1. **⏸️ Pause the research expedition**
2. **💬 Consult with fellow adventurers or community elders (maintainers)**
3. **🗺️ Consider alternative paths forward**
4. **🛡️ Always choose protecting people over advancing research**

---

## 🚨 Calling for Help

### If You Experience Problems:
- **👹 Harassment or inappropriate behavior:** Alert the community guardians (maintainers) immediately
- **⚖️ Ethical concerns about research:** Raise them in the relevant GitHub issue for community discussion
- **🕸️ Privacy violations:** Report them privately to project maintainers
- **🔥 Unsafe situations:** Your safety comes first—step back and report when you're secure

### How to Reach Us:
- **📋 GitHub Issues:** For non-sensitive ethical questions and community discussion
- **📧 Direct Contact:** [Include contact method for sensitive issues]

## 🎯 Special Territories (Extra Care Required)

### 💚 Working with Sensitive Subjects
**Mental health, medical conditions, trauma, accessibility challenges**

- **📋 Extra consent required:** People should clearly understand their experiences might be shared
- **⚖️ Know our limits:** We're builders and researchers, not therapists, doctors, or counselors
- **⚠️ Content warnings:** Include them when discussing potentially distressing topics
- **🔗 Resource sharing:** Always include links to appropriate professional help

### 🌍 Cross-Cultural Expeditions
**When adventuring across different communities and cultures**

- **🎭 Cultural sensitivity:** What's welcoming in one culture may be offensive in another
- **🗣️ Language bridges:** Ensure understanding isn't lost in translation
- **⚖️ Power dynamics:** Be aware of differences in privilege and access between communities
- **🏡 Local wisdom:** Always include voices from the communities you're exploring

### 👶 Working with Young Adventurers
**Anyone under 18 requires extra magical protection**

- **👪 Family consent:** Required for any direct interaction or information gathering
- **🏫 Institutional approval:** May be needed for research in schools or youth organizations
- **🎭 Extra anonymization:** Remove any details that could identify a young person
- **📚 Age-appropriate communication:** Ensure materials are understandable and never exploitative
