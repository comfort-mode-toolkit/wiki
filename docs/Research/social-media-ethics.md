# Social Media Ethics Guide 🌐✨
*How to gather wisdom without violating trust or privacy*

## The Sacred Rule of Our Commons
**Anonymous by default, permission always required for attribution.**

Just because someone shared something in a public space doesn't mean they invited researchers to quote them. Treat every post, comment, or discussion like you're eavesdropping on a conversation between friends—because to them, it might feel exactly like that.

Think of this as learning to be a respectful forest visitor: you can observe the wildlife, but you don't capture the animals without permission.

## 🚦 The Magic Traffic Light System

### 🔴 RED LIGHT - Never Quote Without Explicit Permission
- **Direct quotes with any identifying breadcrumbs** (usernames, handles, unique life details)
- **Screenshots showing usernames or profile info**
- **Content from private spaces or closed communities** (even if you're a member)
- **Anything involving young adventurers** (under 18—even with permission, extra magical protection required)
- **Medical/mental health discussions** that could identify someone
- **Personal stories with unique circumstances** that make someone recognizable

### 🟡 YELLOW LIGHT - Proceed with Extra Protective Magic
- **Anonymous paraphrasing** (still describe the source generally: "community members report...")
- **Aggregated wisdom** ("Multiple forest dwellers mentioned...")
- **Common experiences** that don't reveal individual identity
- **Technical discussions** about tools/code (less personal but still needs care)

### 🟢 GREEN LIGHT - Generally Safe Territory (But Stay Respectful)
- **Publicly available statistics** from platforms
- **General trends or patterns** you observe (without specific examples)
- **Information that's already widely documented elsewhere**
- **Your own posts/comments** (but consider impact on others who replied)

## 🗺️ Your Quest Planning Process

### 🌅 Before You Start Your Information Gathering

**1. 🎯 Define Your Mission**
- What specific mystery are you trying to solve?
- How will this wisdom help fellow builders and creators?
- Could you answer this question without using individual posts?

**2. 🛤️ Choose Your Path**
- **🌫️ Pattern Recognition:** General themes (no direct quotes)
- **🔮 Wisdom Synthesis:** Anonymous insights (paraphrased)
- **💎 Direct Wisdom Sharing:** Quotes with permission (rare, special occasions only)

**3. 🛡️ Set Your Protective Boundaries**
- Which communities will you respectfully observe?
- What time period feels appropriate?
- What sacred territories are off-limits? (personal medical info, crisis situations, etc.)

### 🏞️ While Gathering Community Wisdom

**📋 Document Your Journey:**
- Platform and community visited
- Date range explored
- Search terms or keywords used
- Total posts observed vs. posts that informed your understanding

**🚨 Red Flag Alert Check:**
- Is this person in distress or crisis? → Skip entirely, offer resources if appropriate
- Does this identify someone uniquely? → Anonymize completely or pass by
- Would I be comfortable if this were my post? → If no, don't use

### 🎭 For Anonymous Wisdom Sharing

**🌟 Excellent Approach:**
> "Community members in accessibility spaces report that high contrast modes can trigger headaches and vestibular symptoms. Several discussions highlighted specific color combinations being particularly challenging during longer browsing sessions."

**⚠️ Definitely Avoid This:**
> "User RedditUser123 posted in r/accessibility that 'high contrast gives me migraines and makes me dizzy, especially the blue-white combinations.' This was supported by CommentReply456 who said..."

### 💎 For Direct Wisdom Quotes (Rare Sacred Occasions Only)

**When it might be justified:**
- The exact words contain crucial technical insight that paraphrasing would lose
- It's a positive testimonial and the person would likely want recognition
- It's already been widely shared and attributed elsewhere
- It demonstrates a specific point that general wisdom can't capture

**🗝️ Required Steps for Permission:**
1. **📨 Reach out directly** via platform messaging
2. **🌟 Explain your quest** and how you'd like to honor their wisdom
3. **🎫 Ask explicit permission** - don't assume silence means yes
4. **🎭 Offer anonymity** as the comfortable default
5. **👁️ Give them final approval** over how you use their words
6. **🛡️ Honor "no"** gracefully - find another path to make your point

**📜 Respectful Contact Template:**
```
Hi [username],

I'm working on accessibility research with the Comfort Commons community (link to project). Your insight about [general topic] really helped me understand [research question].

Would you be comfortable with me sharing your wisdom anonymously in our research? I wouldn't include your username or any details that could identify you.

If you'd prefer your comment not be referenced at all, that's completely fine - just let me know.

Thanks for sharing your knowledge with the community!
[Your name/project contact]

## 🎭 Anonymization Magic (Making People Invisible in the Best Way)

### ✨ Remove All Identifying Breadcrumbs
- **Usernames and handles** - obviously
- **Platform-specific clues** ("this subreddit," "our Discord server")
- **Timestamps** that could help someone track down the original post
- **Unique circumstances** that make someone identifiable in their community
- **Cross-references** to other posts or comments by the same person

### 🔮 Scrub Personal Details
- **Medical conditions** - generalize ("vestibular challenges" not "Ménière's disease")
- **Locations** - remove or generalize ("a major city" not "Portland, Oregon")
- **Jobs** - generalize unless crucial ("developer" not "senior React developer at Google")
- **Demographics** - remove unless directly relevant to the accessibility question

### 🌫️ Generalize the Setting
**Instead of:** "In r/vestibular, a user posted..."
**Use:** "In online communities focused on vestibular disorders, members report..."

**Instead of:** "A comment with 50 upvotes said..."
**Use:** "A widely-supported community perspective was that..."

## 📚 Documenting Your Sources (The Visible and Invisible Records)

### 🗄️ For Your Internal Quest Log (Never Public)
Keep detailed records for accountability and fact-checking:
- Original URLs or screenshots (for verification only)
- Date collected
- Platform/community source
- Permission status (if any)

### 🌟 For Public Research (What You Share)
**🌐 General attribution only:**
- "Based on exploration of online accessibility communities"
- "Community discussions from [date range]"
- "Feedback from multiple platforms and forums"
- "Analysis of [number] discussions across [number] communities"

**🚫 Never include:**
- Specific URLs or links
- Platform names if they could lead to identification
- Usernames, handles, or unique identifiers
- Exact post dates or timestamps

## ⚖️ Legal and Ethical Considerations (The Serious Magic)

### 📜 Fair Use vs. Ethical Use
**Legal permission doesn't equal ethical clearance.** Even if something is technically allowed, it might not be kind. Our commons operates by higher standards than legal minimums.

### 🏛️ Platform Terms of Service
- **📋 Check platform policies** about research and data collection
- **⛔ Some platforms prohibit** certain types of data gathering
- **🎓 Academic fair use** might not cover advocacy or community research

### 🌍 International Considerations
- **🇪🇺 GDPR and privacy laws** protect users regardless of where you're based
- **🌈 Different cultural norms** around privacy and consent
- **❓ When uncertain, ask** - it's better than assuming

---

## 🔍 Special Territories (Extra Care Required)

### 💚 Crisis or Mental Health Content
**🛑 Don't use it. Ever.**
- If someone is in distress, they can't meaningfully consent to research use
- Focus on your research mission, not providing individual help (direct them to appropriate resources)
- Mental health discussions require the strongest protective magic

### 🔧 Technical vs. Personal Content
**Technical discussions** (about code, tools, bugs) might need less protection than personal experiences, but still:
- Anonymize by default
- Consider impact on someone's professional reputation
- Be extra careful with criticism of specific tools or companies

### 🗑️ Deleted or Edited Content
**If someone deleted their post:** They removed it from public view - honor that choice
**If someone edited their post:** Use the current version or skip it entirely

### 🏘️ Community-Specific Norms
Different communities have different comfort levels:
- **🏥 Medical communities:** Maximum privacy protection needed
- **💼 Professional spaces:** Consider career impact of any reference
- **💚 Support communities:** Highest bar for consent and anonymization

## 🚨 When Things Go Sideways (Damage Control Magic)

### 😰 If Someone Objects After You've Published
**🏃‍♀️ Immediate response:**
1. Take their concern seriously and listen fully
2. Remove the content if possible
3. Apologize sincerely and explain what you'll do differently
4. Update your research process based on their feedback

### 😬 If You Realize You Made a Mistake
**🪞 Own it completely:**
1. Remove problematic content immediately
2. Contact affected individuals if possible and appropriate
3. Document what went wrong to prevent future issues
4. Share lessons learned with the community (anonymously, of course)
